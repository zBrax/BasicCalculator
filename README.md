# BasicCalculator
This is a project of Visual Studio 2019 to make a "efficient" calculator, you can do anything on it, to learn code, and other things.
BUT, if you will use this repository, you need to give credits to me, put: "Original Code by zBrax" and you not can sell it like a final programs that is all yours, so dont do it.
Thanks!
